GETTING UPDATES EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

And, somehow, I completed my adventure on 42 Istanbul. I know I'll always got goosebumps when I think of it. This adventure contains my top happiest and stressful memories as I can remember.

GO JUMP ON THAT POOL!

Hi, I'm TarÄ±k and that repo is my journal of my 42-Istanbul Piscine adventure.

Please, please don't use the files for your Piscine adventure. Trust me; if you use this repo, you'll miss all the fun. For those who you wondering "So if we shouldn't use this repo, what is it for?", it's for you to study better. I'm trying to create the most practical functions possible. So what you actually need to do is just compare our codes and see is there any difference.

Exams aren't added but they will. Soon.

Welcome to the pool, quack-quack.
