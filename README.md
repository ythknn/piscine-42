# piscine-42

Hi, I'm TarÄ±k and that repo is my journal of my 42-Istanbul Piscine adventure.

Please, please don't use the files for your Piscine adventure. Trust me; if you use this repo, you'll miss all the fun. For those who you wondering "So if we shouldn't use this repo, what is it for?", it's for you to study better. I'm trying to create the most practical functions possible. So what you actually need to do is just compare our codes and see is there any difference.

Welcome to the pool, quack-quack.
